Interactive Guitar Tablature Viewer
====
The Interactive Guitar Tablature Viewer is an application designed to assist with learning to play guitar songs using tablature. Tablature is a common format used to display music to be played by the guitar. It provides a simpler, more intuitive layout for reading music than the standard sheet format. However, it does not provide the same level of detail as sheet music, particularly when it comes to timing. IGTV was developed with the aim of using a Graphical User Interface to provide a dynamic view of Guitar Tablature, teaching a song in an intuitive manner without having to sacrifice any of a song's information in the process.
